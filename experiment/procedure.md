The experiment is design to understand and learn the image arithmetic concepts. This experiment consists five parts:

1. Image addition

2. Image Subtraction

3. Image Difference

4. Image Multiplication

5. Image Division

**Steps to run the experiments**

1. Select image from the mosaic using 'select image' option

   - Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel

   - Select secondary image by choosing either of the 'dull' , 'bright' or 'gradient' images

2. Select one option from 'addition', 'subtraction', 'difference', 'multiplication' and 'division'

   - Select the one option from 'clipping' and 'auto-scaling'

3. Select run option to perform the operations

   - Output result will be displayed in the output panel

   - Along with intermediate results


Interesting Observations

1. Do the Subtraction and Difference operations, and compare the results.

2. Do the Multiplication operation first with clipping and then with auto-scaling, and compare the results.
